191. Number of 1 Bits
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

/*class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int sum = 0;
        while(n>0)
        {
            int digit = n%10;
            if(digit&1)
            //if(digit==1)
            {
                sum =sum++;
            }
            n=n/10;
        }
    
    return sum;   
    }
};*/
// we can not use this as it is not a decimal number on binary numbers only operations like right and left shift can be done 
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count = 0;
        while(n!=0)
        {
            if(n&1)
            {
                count++;
            }
            n=n>>1;
        }
        return count;
    }
