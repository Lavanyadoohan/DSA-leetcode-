1780. Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three
Given an integer n, return true if it is possible to represent n as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return false.

An integer y is a power of three if there exists an integer x such that y == 3x.
Basics of Number System

Intuition:
The question basically asks if n can be represented with base 3 (similar to binary representation which uses 2 as a base).
Simplest method of converting a number to binary (that I know of):

Divide n by 2, prefix the remainder to binary representation of n
n = quotient
Repeat step 1 and 2 until n < 2
The ony difference here is that all the numbers can be represented in base 2 number system since the remainder is either 0 or 1, but is case of 3, the remainders can be 0,1 or 2. So if at all the remainder is 2, we cannot represent n as sum of power 3.

Code:

bool checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        if(n==1)
            return true;
        if(n%3==2)
            return false;
        return checkPowersOfThree(n/3);
    }
We are not storing the remainder in the code, since it is of no use to the problem here.
